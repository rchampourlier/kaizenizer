# Kaizenizer Metrics

`Kaizenizer` generates significative key performance indicators (KPIs) of your product development teams by looking into Jira and Github's data. Data is extracted using APIs and stored into a Postgres database (using `Kaizenizer-Source-X` sub-projects). `Kaizenizer` then uses the data in the Postgres DB to generate metrics that can be displayed easily using a tool like Grafana. You can also directly build visualization from the data generated by `Kaizenizer-Source-X` sub-projects in data-visualization tools like Metabase.

### Why?

["That which is measured, improves", Karl Pearson or Peter Drucker](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/14952/that-which-is-measured-improves)

Measuring KPIs for a product development team is required to drive continuous improvement. We aspire to be always improving, so we need to measure the results of our actions and find ways to quantify our performance.

### Metrics

- [x] Lead Time
- [x] Cycle Time
- [ ] Counts of issues per type and status. This enables the following measures:
  - [ ] Number of `Bug` or `Technical Debt` issues over time
  - [ ] Number of issues in `WIP`
  - [ ] Ratio of issues in `WIP` to number of developers
  - [ ] Cumulative flow diagrams
- [ ] Code inventory

### Inspiration

Though the project started a long time ago with [Agilizer](https://github.com/jobteaser/agilizer_source), the later updates have been heavily influenced by [SoundCloud's Project Development KPIs](https://github.com/soundcloud/project-dev-kpis) project. Their project is quite similar in its purpose, with a different technical implementation. The main difference is that `Kaizenizer` retrieves history data from Jira and Github to generate past metrics, while SoundCloud's will generate new metrics from the time it's started. And it's written in Python instead of Golang ;)

## Use

**TODO**

## Implementation

For all metrics, events are loaded from the database's `jira_issues_events` table and converted to `store.Event` structs. 

For status changes, the `valueFrom` and `valueTo` fields will contain one of the following statuses:

- `backlog`
- `wip`
- `done`
- `resolved`

These statuses are mapped from Jira original statuses. The mapping is done in `store/pgstore.go:statusGroup()`.
